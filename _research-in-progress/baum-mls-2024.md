title: "Direct and Indirect Effects of New Housing on Neighborhood Gentrification"

excerpt: 'Many US cities have recently loosened restrictions on land development to address housing shortages. While this theoretically reduces rents and benefits low-income households, household demand can also change when housing or resident characteristics change, making the equilibrium effects of expansions unclear. In this paper, I show that reforms that expand supply of desirable housing in desirable neighborhoods can have distributional consequences, improving the welfare of a city’s higher-income residents while making some lower-income residents worse-off. I study the effects of Houston’s 1998 minimum lot size reduction, which allowed construction of new, small single-family homes in the city’s downtown. Using new distributional synthetic con- trol methods, I estimate that the reform resulted in higher-income households moving downtown, poor families moving out, and rents increasing throughout Houston. Down- town neighborhood quality improved but low-income households did not benefit, living in similar neighborhoods further from downtown after the reform. These results show the importance of considering heterogeneity in households’ location and housing pref- erences when designing land-use reforms.'
