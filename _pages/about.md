I am a 4th-year PhD student in Public Policy & Economics at the University of Michigan. I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and an Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Pre-Doctoral Fellow. 

My primary research fields are labor and public finance. I study how social environments and public policy affect the economic well-being and political identities of children and young adults.
