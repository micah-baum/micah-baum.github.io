Welcome! I am a 5th-year PhD student in Public Policy & Economics at the University of Michigan. 

I study how public policy affects children and young adults, with a particular interest in economic inequality and political identity. My primary research fields are labor economics and public finance. 

I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and an Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Pre-Doctoral Fellow.
