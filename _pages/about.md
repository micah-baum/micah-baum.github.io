Welcome! I am a 5th-year PhD student in Public Policy & Economics at the University of Michigan. I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and an Institute of Education Sciences (IES) Pre-Doctoral Fellow. 

My primary research fields are labor economics and public finance. I study how public policy affects children and young adults, with a particular interest in socioeconomic mobility and political identity. 

You can find my CV [here](https://micah-baum.github.io/files/baum_cv.pdf).
