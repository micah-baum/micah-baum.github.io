  This paper examines whether school COVID-19 policies influenced enrollment differently by student age and race/ethnicity. Unlike much prior research, we i) analyze enrollments for virtually the entire U.S. public school population for both the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 school years, ii) compare enrollment trends within districts in order to isolate subgroup heterogeneity from district characteristics, and iii) account for district selection into preferred learning modes. Analyzing data on over 9,000 districts that serve more than 90% of public school students in the United States, we find enrollment responses to COVID policies differed notably. We find that White enrollments declined more than Black, Hispanic, and Asian enrollments in districts that started the 2020–2021 school year virtually, but in districts that started in-person the reverse was true: Non-White enrollments declined more than White enrollments. Moreover, Black, Hispanic, and Asian families responded more than White families to higher COVID-19 death rates in the months preceding the start of the 2021 school year. In 2021–2022, enrollment differences by the previous year’s learning mode persisted. Racial/ethnic differences did not vary by whether the district required masking in classrooms. These findings are consistent with the greater risk faced by communities of color during the pandemic and demonstrate an additional source of disparate impact from COVID policies.

Detroit students who obtain a college degree overcome many obstacles to do so. This article reports the results of a randomized evaluation of a program meant to provide support to low-income community college students. The Detroit Promise Path program was designed to complement an existing College Promise scholarship, providing students with coaching, summer engagement, and financial incentives. The evaluation found that students offered the program enrolled in more semesters and earned more credits compared with those offered the scholarship alone. However, at the 3-year mark, there were no discernable impacts on degrees earned. This article examines systemic barriers to degree completion and offers lessons for the design of interventions to increase equity in postsecondary attainment.

It is claimed that Democratic college professors cause their students to become more liberal. In this paper, we study whether there is scope for professors to do so. We link voter registration data to salary records from 33 state flagship universities to document the partisanship of college faculty and use transcript data from one flagship university to study the causal effect of instructors on student partisanship. College faculty are more likely to identify as Democrats than the country as a whole, especially in the humanities and social sciences. Students are mostly liberals when they enter college, become more liberal regardless of their major, and sort to courses where instructors share their political ideology. Exploiting plausibly random variation in when instructors teach a given course, we do not find a relationship between faculty partisanship and changes in student partisanship, and are able to rule out even small liberalizing effects, including when we restrict to courses in the humanities and social sciences. To understand these results, we study variation in the frequency of left-leaning course topics. Liberal-oriented topics are not featured at higher rates when departments have more Democrats or when Democratic instructors teach a given course, meaning student sorting leaves little room for indoctrination.

**Peer Effects on Low-Income College Student Expectations and Achievement** <span style="font-size:85%; color:gray;">with Nikhil Rao </span>  <br>

    <div style="font-size: 90%;">
In this paper we examine how peers' socio-economic backgrounds affect the educational outcomes, experiences, and human capital investment decisions of low-income college students. Using random assignment of first-year roommates and administrative student records, we find that low-income first-year students randomly paired with very high-income roommates perform worse in terms of GPA than low-income students randomly paired with other types of room-mates, even after two years in college. To understand more about these patterns, we developed and piloted a survey of first-year undergraduate students. We find that low-income students spend relatively little time with their randomly assigned high-income roommates and are less likely to report that the roommate has helped them socially, academically, or with their career goals. Going forward, we are expanding the survey to further investigate mechanisms.
