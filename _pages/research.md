### **[Racial differences in parent response to COVID schooling policies](https://micah-baum.github.io/files/baum-jacob-pnas-2024.pdf)** (with Brian A. Jacob). 
_Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, 2024. 
Presented at: AEFP 2023. <details> <summary>Abstract</summary>  
This paper examines whether school COVID-19 policies influenced enrollment differently by student age and race/ethnicity. Unlike much prior research, we i) analyze enrollments for virtually the entire U.S. public school population for both the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 school years, ii) compare enrollment trends within districts in order to isolate subgroup heterogeneity from district characteristics, and iii) account for district selection into preferred learning modes. Analyzing data on over 9,000 districts that serve more than 90% of public school students in the United States, we find enrollment responses to COVID policies differed notably. We find that White enrollments declined more than Black, Hispanic, and Asian enrollments in districts that started the 2020–2021 school year virtually, but in districts that started in-person the reverse was true: Non-White enrollments declined more than White enrollments. Moreover, Black, Hispanic, and Asian families responded more than White families to higher COVID-19 death rates in the months preceding the start of the 2021 school year. In 2021–2022, enrollment differences by the previous year’s learning mode persisted. Racial/ethnic differences did not vary by whether the district required masking in classrooms. These findings are consistent with the greater risk faced by communities of color during the pandemic and demonstrate an additional source of disparate impact from COVID policies.

### Direct and Indirect Effects of New Housing on Neighborhood Gentrification. 
_Peter Eckstein Prize for Interdisciplinary Research and Policy Analysis_, 2024. 
Presented at: AREUEA 2024. <details> <summary>Abstract</summary>  
Many US cities have recently loosened restrictions on land development to address housing shortages. While this theoretically reduces rents and benefits low-income households, household demand can also change when housing or resident characteristics change, making the equilibrium effects of expansions unclear. In this paper, I show that reforms that expand supply of desirable housing in desirable neighborhoods can have distributional consequences, improving the welfare of a city’s higher-income residents while making some lower-income residents worse-off. I study the effects of Houston’s 1998 minimum lot size reduction, which allowed construction of new, small single-family homes in the city’s downtown. Using new distributional synthetic con- trol methods, I estimate that the reform resulted in higher-income households moving downtown, poor families moving out, and rents increasing throughout Houston. Down- town neighborhood quality improved but low-income households did not benefit, living in similar neighborhoods further from downtown after the reform. These results show the importance of considering heterogeneity in households’ location and housing pref- erences when designing land-use reforms.
