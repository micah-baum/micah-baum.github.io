  This paper examines whether school COVID-19 policies influenced enrollment differently by student age and race/ethnicity. Unlike much prior research, we i) analyze enrollments for virtually the entire U.S. public school population for both the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 school years, ii) compare enrollment trends within districts in order to isolate subgroup heterogeneity from district characteristics, and iii) account for district selection into preferred learning modes. Analyzing data on over 9,000 districts that serve more than 90% of public school students in the United States, we find enrollment responses to COVID policies differed notably. We find that White enrollments declined more than Black, Hispanic, and Asian enrollments in districts that started the 2020–2021 school year virtually, but in districts that started in-person the reverse was true: Non-White enrollments declined more than White enrollments. Moreover, Black, Hispanic, and Asian families responded more than White families to higher COVID-19 death rates in the months preceding the start of the 2021 school year. In 2021–2022, enrollment differences by the previous year’s learning mode persisted. Racial/ethnic differences did not vary by whether the district required masking in classrooms. These findings are consistent with the greater risk faced by communities of color during the pandemic and demonstrate an additional source of disparate impact from COVID policies.

Detroit students who obtain a college degree overcome many obstacles to do so. This article reports the results of a randomized evaluation of a program meant to provide support to low-income community college students. The Detroit Promise Path program was designed to complement an existing College Promise scholarship, providing students with coaching, summer engagement, and financial incentives. The evaluation found that students offered the program enrolled in more semesters and earned more credits compared with those offered the scholarship alone. However, at the 3-year mark, there were no discernable impacts on degrees earned. This article examines systemic barriers to degree completion and offers lessons for the design of interventions to increase equity in postsecondary attainment.

**When Do Children Benefit From Gentrification?** <br>
_Peter Eckstein Prize for Interdisciplinary Research and Policy Analysis_, 2024. <br>
Presented at: AREUEA 2024.

    <div style="font-size: 90%;"> 
In the last few decades, many urban neighborhoods have "gentrified,” experiencing increases in housing costs and amenities driven by immigration of high-income households. In this paper, I document whether incumbent low-income children benefit from gentrification, and study what drives these effects. I focus on neighborhood change occurring in downtown Houston, Texas, stemming from the city's 1998 downtown housing reform incentivizing construction of single-family homes. I first show that the reform caused downtown gentrification as high-income households moved into the area. Because local amenities improved, rents grew even as housing supply increased. Using Census microdata and administrative education and earnings data, I estimate propensity score-weighted difference-in-differences models to test whether this neighborhood change displaced incumbent renters and affected childrens' long-run educational and labor market outcomes. I find little evidence of displacement, due to the fact that renters and low-income households move frequently even in the absence of gentrification. Children exposed to gentrification were more likely to graduate from college and earn 5% more on average in their late 20s. Earnings effects are only present for children who remained in the treated area as it gentrified. Households avoid direct exposure to rent increases but children attend better schools with more socioeconomically advantaged families, potentially explaining these effects.
