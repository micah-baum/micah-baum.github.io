I am a 5th-year PhD student in Public Policy & Economics at the University of Michigan. I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin and graduated from Boston University with a BA in Economics & Sociology. 

After graduating, I moved to Baltimore, where I worked as a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for three years. I spent two years serving as an AmeriCorps member in urban public schools, as a City Year corps member in Columbus, Ohio (2013-14) and a Literacy Lab member in Baltimore, Maryland (2020-21).
