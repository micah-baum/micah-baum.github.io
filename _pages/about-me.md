I am a 4th-year PhD student in Public Policy & Economics at the University of Michigan. I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin and graduated from Boston University *summa cum laude* with a BA in Economics & Sociology. 

After graduating, I moved to Baltimore, where I worked as a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for three years. I have spent two years volunteering in urban public schools with AmeriCorps, as a City Year corps member in Columbus, Ohio (2013-14) and a Literacy Lab member in Baltimore, Maryland (2020-21). 

At Michigan, my primary fields in economics are labor and public finance. My research focuses on how social environments affect children and college students, with a particular interest in socioeconomic inequality. 

In my free time, you can find me on a run or hike, baking, or watching Arsenal Football Club.
